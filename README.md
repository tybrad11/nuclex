# NucLex
NucLex is a nuclear medicine-specific ontology that is intended to supplement [RadLex](https://radlex.org/), the main radiology ontology. 

NucLex***.owl is the latest version of the NucLex ontology. It can be viewed in Protégé, which is freely available software from Stanford.
(note: NucLex and Radlex are not easily viewable in WebProtégé because the class names are stored in AnnotationProperty PreferredName)

Scripts: 
Several scripts are provided that were used to identify terms from nuclear medicine literature. Scripts are also provided that were used to convert between a csv-formatted ontology to an OWL ontology.
